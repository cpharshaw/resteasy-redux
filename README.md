RestEasy is a full-stack web application that aims to be Yelp for public restrooms. It uses the Foursquare API to present establishments on a Google Map, and authenticated users can submit reviews of restroom(s) based on cleanliness, style, etc. Photo uploads are optional as part of the review; photo management is handled with Cloudinary's API. Reviews are aggregated and summarized on place cards.
